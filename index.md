## WHOAMI

My name is Justin Nitz. I've been active in the field of information security for 6+ years. I have a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and I enjoy learning all things related to security and software engineering. I currently work as a red team member where I perform internal penetration testing and secure code reviews. In my spare time I test applications as a member of the Synack Red Team.

When I'm not writing or testing code, I can be found playing the trumpet, french horn, or piano.
