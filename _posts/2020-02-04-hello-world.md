Hello Internet! This is my new static site built with Jekyll. I hope to keep a blog going to inform the community about my journey through the rigorous coursework from Offensive Security. I've been studying for the OSCE exam for quite some time and have been getting better at debugging assembly and finding exploits every day. I'll try to blog at least once a week in order provide technical content to the infosec community on concepts regarding software engineering, exploit development, and much more. Hope to see you in the near future!
